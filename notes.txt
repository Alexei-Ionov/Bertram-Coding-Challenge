the idea is this: 

- i'll create a story-like program where each day I the coworkers go to coffee shop, decide what cofee they want
  then one person pays for it which adds to their total that they've spent, screen fades and the next day statrs

- selection algorithm for who pays will be as follows: 
    - turn gets decided by who's payed the least. 
        - if multiple people have paid the same amount (such as in the case in the beginnning), then we can simulate a pseudo-random n-sided dice toss

    
GUI: 
- gui for story line (ex: DAY 1)
- fades to black
- gui of coworkers walking to the coffee shop
- UI which allows user to determine what each person gets for a drink. HOWEVER, bob always gets a cappucino (good choice) and jeremy likes his cofee black  
- gui for cofee orders & prices
- sidebar gui showing total cost each coworker has thus far paid for 
-
